            <p><strong>Buy less, do more. Stop buying what you don't need and buy an experience instead.</strong> The concept of minimalism confronts consumerist values and explains that having less is not only psychologically more beneficial but also environmentally. Minimalism is strongly opposed to the accumulation of materialistic possessions and therefore waste production. Making the decision to not buy another item of clothing you don't really need can not only save you money but bring you clarity of mind and free up physical space and mental space. Spend your money on a holiday, a theatre performance, golf instead of on clothes you already have. We are proposing you buy experiences that generate higher emotional value than materialistic objects. Sure a good t-shirt or pair of shoes will give you momentary pleasure but the memory of a good experience lasts a lot longer and is more beneficial to your health. Living more simply, with a focus on memories and experiences instead of possessions results in benefits not only for you but for the environment. The global waste problem is fueled by a consuming attitude. Change yours. Buy less. Do more.</p>
