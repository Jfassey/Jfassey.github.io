            <p><strong>The clothing industry is the second largest polluter in the world. Second only to oil.</strong> The nature of consumerist western society is encouraging behaviour that favours mass waste production. The processes of commercialism, fueled by consumers is contributing to huge environmental waste problems. Globalisation has allowed clothing to be produced at increasingly low prices. As a result the quality of clothing is low, causing garments to be disposed of after only a short time of wear. Commercialism has determined that most things sold on the market are designed for the dump. This is more commonly known as ‘fast fashion’. Per year in New Zealand over 100 million kilos of textile waste is thrown into rubbish dumps and more than 5.8 million kilos of used clothing is exported to countries like Papua New Guinea through SaveMart initiatives. Even though this solution provides clothing for the less fortunate, it is still only temporary, as the clothing will still be dumped, just in a different country. Instead of providing temporary solutions for the waste problem, we thought why not create a solution for the behaviour that's creating the waste in the first place?</p>

                <p>More than 15 million tons of used
                textile waste is generated each
                year in the United States alone,
                and the amount has doubled over
                the last 20 years.</p>

                <p>Making cotton products takes its
                toll on the planet. It takes 2700
                liters of water to make one cotton
                shirt. An inordinate amount of the
                world’s clean water.</p>

                <p>The fashion industry produces
                clothes for 52 seasons. That's a
                new style every week. Some stores
                even make sure that clothes get
                slashed before throwing them out.</p>
